# seven-eleven-nutritional-analysis
This project scrapes publicly available nutritional data from the Seven Eleven Japan website and analyzes the protein efficiency of their sandwich products. The goal is to identify which items offer the best protein-to-calorie and protein-to-yen performance. The analysis is rather simplistic for now, but I hope to expand on this soon.

In this first iteration of the project, I mainly demonstrate web scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup, data extraction with regular expressions, and simple data type cleaning using pandas. I implemented the simple features "protein per 100 kcal" and "protein per yen".

SevenEleven_Sandwich_Analysis.ipynb — Main notebook with all current operations.

In the future, I would like to expand upon the analysis by scraping other categories of food items, analyzing more complex features to show more skill with pandas, and perhaps adding some visuals with matplotlib.
